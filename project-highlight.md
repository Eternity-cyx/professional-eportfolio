# 🌱 Project Highlight: LLM-Augmented Scientific Modeling in Agriculture

## Overview

This project explores the integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into traditional scientific modeling workflows, particularly in the context of **environmental and agricultural systems**. I joined the research team led by **Professor Xiaowei Jia** at the University of Pittsburgh, where we investigate novel strategies to augment domain modeling using LLMs.

## Motivation

Scientific models often require expert-defined parameters and simulation settings, which can be limited by time, cost, and accessibility to domain knowledge. In the field of agriculture and environmental science, these constraints can slow down model development and limit adaptability across scenarios (e.g., changing weather, soil conditions, or crop types).

By leveraging LLMs, we aim to **automate and improve the decision-making process** in the early stages of model configuration—enhancing both efficiency and performance.

## My Contribution

- **Literature Review**: Investigated prior work on LLM applications in scientific workflows and decision support systems.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Assisted in designing prompts to help LLMs evaluate and explain modeling parameters.
- **Evaluation Design**: Contributed ideas for testing whether LLM-suggested configurations align with expert judgment or produce more optimal results.

## Why It Matters

- 🔁 Bridges the gap between **AI and domain-specific science**
- 🌾 Provides a scalable solution to improve **climate-resilient agriculture**
- 🧠 Applies **LLMs in real-world decision support**, beyond chat-based applications
